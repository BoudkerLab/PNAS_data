$ git init % make sure you dont have a pre-initialized repo in your directory
$ git lfs install % you'll need to run this after you create the repo, make sure you have git lfs downloaded before all of these commands, you can do so by running brew install git-lfs from your home directory
$ git lfstrack "file_name.ext"
$ git add .gitattributes
$ git lfs track % if everything worked until now you should see 2 files being tracked
$ git add file_name.ext
$ git commit -m "whatever comment you wanna associate with this action"
$ git remote add <PNAS_trajectories> <https://github.com/BoudkerLab/PNAS_data.git>
